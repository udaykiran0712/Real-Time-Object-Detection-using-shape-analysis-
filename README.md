# Real-Time-Object-Detection-using-shape-analysis

Now-a-days more people are shopping in online, at the time of festivals and occasions there is a higher demand for products to store in warehouses. This puts extra pressure on employees who have to sort and package items, potentially causing delays in deliveries. The focus of this project is on analyzing the shape  of objects using computer vision, specifically on the Arduino platform. By incorporating Arduino, we're making this technology more accessible for real-world applications. By combining Arduino with IoT (Internet of Things) technologies, the system can be connected to a network for remote monitoring and control. This facilitates centralized management of multiple warehouse locations. The potential of using data collected by the Arduino-based system to gain insights into key aspects of warehouse operations, allowing for better decision-making and optimization of resources. Some advantages of this project include streamlining warehouse operations, reducing human error in sorting and packaging and reduces time consumption.
